            <a target="_blank" href="https://angular.io/docs">Documentation. </a>Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular combines
            declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development
            challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop</p>
          <p>The documentation assumes that you are already familiar with JavaScript, and some of the tools from the latest
            standards such as classes and modules. The code samples are written using TypeScript. Most Angular code can be
            written with just the latest JavaScript, using types for dependency injection, and using decorators for metadata.

            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html">Documentation. </a>TypeScript starts from the same syntax and semantics that millions of JavaScript developers
            know today. Use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript code
            from JavaScript.</p>
          <p>TypeScript compiles to clean, simple JavaScript code which runs on any browser, in Node.js, or in any JavaScript
            engine that supports ECMAScript 6 (or newer).</p>
