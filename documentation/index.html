			<strong>A) Features</strong> -
			<a href="#toc">top</a>
		</h3>
		<p>This application includes the features of most of project management software: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Dashboard</h3>
				<p>This module is designed to help managers to take decisions by showing them the most important information that the web
					app is generating, data like a chart for the financial status, that include the expenses and the increses, also the
					current tasks, some contacts to make faster chat and little number of projects that you have create.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Projects</h3>
				<p>This is the main module, to create projects that will have all the information necesarry, to create a new project first
					you have to make a category, rather be new, in progress, cancelled, complete, etc. So after you create the category
					you go to All Projects and click on new project enter all the information and click on save, after that the table is
					going to refresh automatically and you will be able to see, update, and delete.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Tasks</h3>
				<p>After the creation of a project you can start creating new Tasks for that project or any other, in this module you will
					have to options to see all of your assigned tasks or all the existing tasks, in this case to create a new one, just
					click on new task and enter the information, click on save and the table is going to refresh automatically and you will
					be able to see, update, and delete.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Teams</h3>
				<p>The team module is important to keep the information of all the employees that work for a project and what tasks they
					have, so first include a new member to the web app, go to Members and click new Member enter the information of the
					user and then go to Team Roles to create a new role, this is to give a user the permissions that he can have, for example
					user can see projects but cant add new team members, after that go to All Teams and click on new team member, choose
					the member you create and the project that works on, and give that user the role it has.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Finance</h3>
				<p>In project management it is important to keep the financial status of every entry of the project so in this module it
					is included an entry category, so first go to Categories and create a new type, and then create a new Entry by going
					to Finance and create new entry, enter the information with the amount of money and the category of entry, and save
					it, after that the table is going to refresh automatically and you will be able to see, update, and delete.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Notes</h3>
				<p>It is always important to take notes of important information that can help us or the team in the future so the notes
					module will have your personal notes, and also the notes of the projects, to the employees to know when a note is created,
					everything you do is go to All Notes, create new note and enter the information, after that the table is going to refresh
					automatically and you will be able to see, update, and delete.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Maps</h3>
				<p>This module was to look over different locations to know important aspects like where are the project is going to be
					develop, if there are other locations the company can use, where are the competitions and how can we keep in track of
					the services the company is going to offer with the creation of the project that and more.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Settings</h3>
				<p>This module is only to modify your own personal information, this kind of information is the one your employees are going
					to see, so the user most have the chance to update the information in case it is necessary</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

			<strong>B) Server Side</strong> -
			<a href="#toc">top</a>
		</h3>
		<h6>This app server side was develop with three new technologies, PostgreSQL, Sequelize and Upload to web with Heroku: </h6>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<img src="./assets/images/postgresql.png" />
				<br>
				<p>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/">Documentation. </a>PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years
					of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity,
					and correctness. It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, macOS, Solaris), and
					Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures
					(in multiple languages). </p>

				<p>It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL , and TIMESTAMP.
					It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces
					for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="./assets/images/sequelize.png" />
				<br>
				<p>
					<a target="_blank" href="http://docs.sequelizejs.com/">Documentation. </a>Sequelize.js is an ORM (Object/Relational Mapper) which provides easy access to MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite
					or PostgreSQL databases by mapping database entries to objects and vice versa. It has very powerful migrations mechanism
					that can transform existing database schema into a new version. It also provides database synchronization mechanisms
					that can create database structure by specifying the model structure.</p>
				<p>Although Sequelize.js is new library, it have been battle tested. Currently web sites like Shutterstock, Clevertech,
					Metamarkets and Innofluence have announced that they are using Sequelize.js as ORM of their website.</p>

			<li>
				<img src="./assets/images/heroku.png" />
				<br>
				<p>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference">Documentation. </a>Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy,
					manage, and scale modern apps. Our platform is elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers the simplest
					path to getting their apps to market.</p>

				<p>provides a SQL database-as-a-service that lets you focus on building your application instead of messing around with
					database management.

					<a target="_blank" href="https://angular.io/docs">Documentation. </a>Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular combines declarative
					templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges.
					Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop</p>
				<p>The documentation assumes that you are already familiar with JavaScript, and some of the tools from the latest standards
					such as classes and modules. The code samples are written using TypeScript. Most Angular code can be written with just
					the latest JavaScript, using types for dependency injection, and using decorators for metadata.

				<p>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html">Documentation. </a>TypeScript starts from the same syntax and semantics that millions of JavaScript developers know
					today. Use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript code from JavaScript.</p>
				<p>TypeScript compiles to clean, simple JavaScript code which runs on any browser, in Node.js, or in any JavaScript engine
					that supports ECMAScript 6 (or newer).</p>

					been actively supported for over 10 years by its loving Core Team. Over and over again, the industry is choosing Sass
					as the premier CSS extension language. Sass is actively supported and developed by a consortium of several tech companies
